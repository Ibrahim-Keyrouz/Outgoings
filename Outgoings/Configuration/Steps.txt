Steps :
1- Install Netbeans and be sure you have the latest JDK
2- Install Oracle Database XE 
3- Unlock the user hr on the Database XE
4- Change the HTTP port of OraDB XE because it conflicts with the HTTP port of the Glassfish :
With sqlplus : Exec DBMS_XDB.SETHTTPPORT(the_new_port);
5- Create the tables from the text file "Database Tables" (by copying statement by statement) 
6- Configuring Glassfish (see photos )
   a- Create JDBC Connection Pools : oracle-thin_XE_hrPool
    see photo for details 
   b- Create JDBC Resource : BobDB
    see photo for details 
   c- Copy the file ojdbc7 (from the JARs folder) into : C:\Program Files\glassfish-4.1\glassfish\domains\domain1\lib\    and   
                                                         C:\Program Files\glassfish-4.1\glassfish\domains\domain1\lib\ext 
7- Install the plugin "iReport" from the netbeans website
